    1) For an Attribute
Book -> ISBN: can't be null, empty, has 2 acceptable formats +
some modifications in case of older format
    2) Unique
Book -> ISBN is unique, implemented with HashMap
    3) Subset
2 associations: Book belongs to Collection / Book is a cover of Collection
    4) Ordered
Association (composition) between Order and Customer. All Orders are sorted for Customer:
  - by date (from oldest to newest)
  - by number (desc order)
  // Order{orderNumber=1, creationDate=2022-05-22T18:32:26.608360}
     Order{orderNumber=3, creationDate=2022-05-22T18:32:28.623172}
     Order{orderNumber=2, creationDate=2022-05-22T18:32:28.623172}
    5)Bag
*-* association Book - Comment - Customer
implemented as regular *-* but without isUnique() check
    6) XOR
2 associations: Author sign contract with EPublisher or with PublishingHouse
When creating an Author specify EP or PH
changeEP()/changePH() control removing old associations and creating new ones
    7) Custom Constraint
*-* Association between Book and Order. Each Book has a Priority (how fast we need to sell smth):
    for LOW - min cost is 80 and min ordered quantity i 10
    for MEDIUM - min cost is 50 and min ordered quantity is 5
    for HIGH - min cost is 30 and min quantity is 1

When creating OrderedBook we should check if:
 - it is unique
 - total cost (book.cost * quantity) is not less than set for its Priority
 - total Quantity is not less than set for its Priority
    !!!IN OTHER CASE ASSOCIATION CAN'T BE CREATED!!!
